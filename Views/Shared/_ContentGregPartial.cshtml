     p1="Barry William Blenkhorn (born September 30, 1954), known professionally as Barry Williams, is an 
     American actor and singer best known for his role as the eldest of the Brady sons, Greg Brady, on the 
     ABC television series The Brady Bunch. Williams, the youngest of three boys, was born in 1954 in Santa 
     Monica, California, to Doris May Moore and Canadian-born Frank Millar Blenkhorn, of English, Scottish, 
     and German ancestry. Barry and siblings Craig and Scott Blenkhorn grew up in Pacific Palisades, 
     California, where actor Peter Graves was a neighbor. Williams decided, as a child, that he wanted to 
     be an actor, and in 1967 he made his television debut in a Christmas episode of Dragnet 1967. Williams'
     most famous role was as oldest son Greg Brady on the 1970s sitcom The Brady Bunch. Williams continued 
     to be cast in guest roles on other TV series including Adam-12, The Invaders, That Girl, Mission: 
     Impossible, The Mod Squad, Here Come the Brides, Gomer Pyle USMC, Highway to Heaven and Bartleby, 
     the Scrivener before being cast in 1969 as Greg Brady on The Brady Bunch."
     p2="Following the cancellation of The Brady Bunch in 1974, Williams continued to appear in guest 
     roles on television, and became involved in musical theater, touring with productions such as Grease, 
     The Sound of Music, Pippin, and West Side Story. In 1988, Williams appeared on Broadway in the musical 
     Romance/Romance with Tony Award-nominee Alison Fraser. Williams took over the lead male role of 
     &quot;Alfred/Sam&quot; when Scott Bakula left the production. Years later, Williams was able to 
     capitalize on being typecast as Greg Brady. Amid a procession of appearances in TV and movies that 
     played up his famous teen role, he ended up landing a role that was a departure from the Brady image. 
     He was tapped to play English con man Hannibal in 1984, who conspired with Holly Sutton Scorpio 
     (Emma Samms) on the top-rated General Hospital. Williams has appeared in various Brady Bunch TV movie 
     reunions, including the 1988 Christmas movie, A Very Brady Christmas. Williams has created a cabaret 
     act that pays tribute to his past and hosts the satellite radio trivia show, The Real Greg Brady's 
     Totally '70s Pop Quiz starring Barry Williams, broadcast Saturdays on Sirius Satellite Radio's &quot;70s
     on 7&quot; channel. As of 2019, he makes Branson, Missouri, his home and tours with the musical group 
     Barry Williams and the Traveliers.[14] He also joined with the other Brady Bunch kids in the 2019 
     television series A Very Brady Renovation on HGTV. In 2021, Williams starred in the Lifetime Christmas 
     movie, Blending Christmas, alongside his Brady Bunch co-stars Christopher Knight, Mike Lookinland, Susan 
     Olsen, and Robbie Rist. With the death of Florence Henderson on November 24, 2016, Williams became the 
     oldest surviving cast member from The Brady Bunch." />
