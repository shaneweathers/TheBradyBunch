     p1="Florence Agnes Henderson (February 14, 1934 – November 24, 2016) was an American actress and singer. 
     Henderson, the youngest of 10 children, was born in Dale, Indiana, a small town in the southwestern 
     part of the state. She was a daughter of Elizabeth (née Elder), a homemaker, and Joseph Henderson, a 
     tobacco sharecropper. During the Great Depression, she was taught to sing at the age of two by her 
     mother, who had a repertoire of 50 songs. By the time she was eight, her family called her &quot;
     Florency&quot;, and by age 12, she was singing at local grocery stores. Henderson graduated from 
     St. Francis Academy in Owensboro, Kentucky in 1951 and shortly thereafter went to New York City, 
     enrolling in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She was an Alumna Initiate of the Alpha Chi 
     chapter of Delta Zeta sorority. While her career spanned six decades, she is best remembered for her 
     starring role as Carol Brady on the ABC sitcom The Brady Bunch. Henderson also appeared in film, as well as on stage, and hosted several 
     long-running cooking and variety shows over the years. She appeared as a guest on many scripted and 
     unscripted (talk and reality show) television programs and as a panelist on numerous game shows. She 
     was a contestant on Dancing with the Stars in 2010. Henderson hosted her own talk show, The Florence 
     Henderson Show, and cooking show, Who's Cooking with Florence Henderson, on Retirement Living TV during 
     the years leading up to her death at age 82 on Thanksgiving 2016 from heart failure."
     p2="Henderson married her first husband, Ira Bernstein, in 1956. They had four children together before 
     divorcing in 1985. In 1987, she married her second husband, hypnotherapist Dr. John George Kappas, whom 
     she had met when he treated her for depression and stage fright in the early 1980s. They remained married
     until his death in 2002. Henderson had five grandchildren. Henderson died on November 24, 2016, at 
     Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 82. She had been hospitalized the
     previous day. According to her manager, Kayla Pressman, Henderson died of heart failure. Three days before 
     her death, Henderson had attended the recording of Dancing with the Stars to support her friend and former 
     on-screen daughter Maureen McCormick, who was a contestant. Pressman stated that Henderson was not ill 
     prior to her sudden hospitalization and that her death was a &quot;shock&quot;. She was cremated, and her
     ashes interred at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles." />
