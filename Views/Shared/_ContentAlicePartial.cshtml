     p1="Ann Bradford Davis (May 3, 1926 – June 1, 2014) was an American actress. She achieved prominence for
     her role in the NBC situation comedy The Bob Cummings Show (1955–1959), for which she twice won the 
     Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, but she was best known 
     for playing the part of Alice Nelson, the housekeeper in ABC's The Brady Bunch (1969–1974)."
     p2="From 1969 to 1974, Davis played housekeeper Alice Nelson in The Brady Bunch television series. 
     In 1976, Davis sold her home in Los Angeles to move to Denver, Colorado, where she joined 
     an Episcopal community led by Bishop William C. Frey. The community later relocated to Ambridge 
     in Beaver County in far western Pennsylvania after Frey became dean of the seminary Trinity School 
     for Ministry. Davis had long been a volunteer for the Episcopal Church, working at the General 
     Convention, attending services at churches around the country. She later returned to TV to take part in various Brady Bunch television movies, including The Brady Girls 
     Get Married (1981) and A Very Brady Christmas (1988). She also reprised her role as Alice Nelson in 
     two short-lived Brady Bunch spin-off television series: The Brady Brides (1981) and The Bradys (1990), 
     both of which lasted only six episodes. She also made a cameo appearance as a truck driver named 
     &quot;Schultzy&quot;, a reference to her days on The Bob Cummings Show, in The Brady Bunch Movie 
     in 1995. In 1994, Davis published a cookbook, Alice's Brady Bunch Cookbook, with Brady Bunch 
     inspired recipes. The book also includes recipes from cast members. In the early 1990s, Davis 
     returned to theater. She performed in a production of Arsenic and Old Lace, and both the 
     Broadway production and a world tour of Crazy for You. Davis never completely retired from 
     acting; in her later years she was the celebrity spokeswoman in several Shake 'n Bake commercials, 
     and later appeared in several disposable mop commercials for Swiffer. She also appeared in a number 
     of Brady Bunch reunion projects, most recently TV Land's The Brady Bunch 35th Anniversary Reunion
     Special: Still Brady After All These Years. On April 22, 2007, The Brady Bunch was awarded the TV 
     Land Pop Culture Award on the 5th annual TV Land Awards. Davis and other cast members accepted 
     the award, and she received a standing ovation.

     Davis died at the age of 88 
     on June 1, 2014, at a hospital in San Antonio, Texas. Earlier in the day, she had sustained a 
     subdural hematoma from a fall in her bathroom in her San Antonio residence, in which she lived 
     with Bishop Frey and his wife, Barbara. Sources close to her say she was in excellent health for
     a woman her age, and her death was a complete shock. She is interred in the Saint Helena's 
     Columbarium and Memorial Gardens in Boerne, Texas." />
