     end in 1974. After, Plumb continued to work in television, portraying a teenage prostitute in the NBC 
     television film Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway (1976), and as Elizabeth March in the 1978 miniseries
     Little Women. Plumb continued to reprise her role as Jan Brady on numerous reunion series and films, 
     including The Brady Brides (1981) and A Very Brady Christmas (1988). She made her feature film debut
