     p1="Robert Reed (born John Robert Rietz Jr.; October 19, 1932 – May 12, 1992) was an American actor. He
     played Kenneth Preston on the legal drama The Defenders from 1961 to 1965 alongside E. G. Marshall, and 
     is best known for his role as the father Mike Brady, opposite Florence Henderson's role as Carol Brady, 
     on the ABC sitcom The Brady Bunch, which aired from 1969 to 1974. He later reprised his role of Mike 
     Brady on several of the reunion programs. In 1976, he earned two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for 
     his guest-starring role in a two-part episode of Medical Center and for his work on the miniseries Rich
     Man, Poor Man. The following year, Reed earned a third Emmy nomination for his role in the miniseries 
     Roots."
     p2="From the very beginning of The Brady Bunch's debut in September 1969, Reed was unhappy with his role as 
     Mike Brady. He felt that acting in the often silly program was beneath his training as a serious 
     Shakespearean actor. In his efforts to bring more realism to the sitcom, Reed often locked horns with 
     the program's creator and executive producer Schwartz. Reed regularly presented Schwartz with 
     hand-written memoranda detailing why a certain motivation did not make sense or why it was wrong to 
     combine elements of farce and satire. Schwartz generally ignored Reed's suggestions, although in an 
     attempt to alleviate tension, Schwartz occasionally allowed Reed to direct some episodes. In a 1983 
     interview, Reed admitted that he often butted heads with Schwartz, stating, &quot;We fought over the 
     scripts. Always over the scripts. The producer, Sherwood Schwartz, had done Gilligan's Island...Just 
     gag lines. That would have been what The Brady Bunch would have been if I hadn't protested. After 
     The Brady Bunch series ended in 1974, Reed acted on stage and made guest star appearances on other 
     television series and television movies, including Pray for the Wildcats and SST: Death Flight. He 
     won critical acclaim for his portrayal of Pat Caddison, a doctor who comes out as transgender, in a 
     two-part episode of Medical Center in 1975. The episode also earned him a Primetime Emmy Award 
     nomination. Also that year he appeared in the TV-movie The Secret Night Caller, as a respectably 
     married man with a compulsion to make obscene phone calls to women he barely knows. Reed appeared 
     in the television film The Boy in the Plastic Bubble (1976), the miniseries Rich Man, Poor Man 
     (1976), and the miniseries Roots (1977). Reed was again nominated for an Emmy Award for his 
     work in Rich Man, Poor Man and Roots. He also guest-starred on Wonder Woman, Hawaii Five-O, 
     Charlie's Angels, Galactica 1980 and Vega$. In 1981, Reed won the lead role of Dr. Adam Rose 
     on the medical drama Nurse. Despite critical acclaim, the series was canceled the following 
     year. In 1986, he played the role of Lloyd Kendall on the daytime soap opera Search for Tomorrow. 
     He also made multiple appearances on Fantasy Island, Hunter, The Love Boat and Murder, She Wrote. 
     Despite his dislike of The Brady Bunch and the character of Mike Brady, Reed continued to appear 
     in Brady Bunch spinoffs and sequels for the remainder of his career. In 1976, Reed reprised the 
     role of Mike Brady in the variety show The Brady Bunch Hour, a role he openly embraced because it 
     afforded him the opportunity to sing and dance. He would later appear in the television film 
     The Brady Girls Get Married (1981) and the television film A Very Brady Christmas (1988). In 1989, 
     he guest-starred as Mike Brady in &quot;A Very Brady Episode&quot; of the NBC sitcom Day by Day. 
     Also in 1989, Reed reteamed with his Brady Bunch co-star Henderson in a guest-starring role on 
     the sitcom Free Spirit. In 1990, he reprised the role of Mike Brady for the final time in the 
     drama series, The Bradys. The series was canceled after six episodes. Reed made his last onscreen
     appearance in an April 1992 episode of Jake and the Fatman, &quot;Ain't Misbehavin&quot;. Shortly 
     before his death, Reed appeared in the touring production of Love Letters, opposite Betsy Palmer, 
     and taught classes on Shakespeare at UCLA." />
