     p1="Christopher Anton Knight (born November 7, 1957) is an American actor and businessman. He is best 
     known for playing Peter Brady on the 1970s series The Brady Bunch. He has since gone on to become a 
     successful businessman and enjoyed a semi-resurgence in the public eye with television appearances 
     in the 2000s. In 1988, Knight, a self-described &quot;geek&quot;, left acting to pursue a business 
     career in the computer industry. He got a job as an account sales manager for Martec, Inc. and 
     landed that company's first million-dollar sales deal within his first 18 months on the job, for 
     which he was named Employee of the Year. In 1989, he was named Vice President of Design System
     Marketing and Sales at New Image Industry."
     p2="In 1991, he co-founded Visual Software, a pioneering 3D graphics company. In 1995, he founded 
     Kidwise Learningware, a company that manufactures interactive educational products. In 1996, he 
     joined the keyboard manufacturer Adesso, and in 1997, he became Vice President of Marketing at 
     iXMicro, a video hardware company. In 1998, he founded his own TV tuner company, Eskape Labs; 
     it was purchased by Hauppauge Computer Works in 2000. On April 17, 1994, Knight lost his 
     professional wrestling debut in a &quot;Dark Match&quot; at the Spring Stampede in Chicago 
     at the Rosemont Horizon. His adversary was another child star from 1970s television, the 
     Partridge Family's Danny Bonaduce. Knight appeared on a special episode of The Weakest Link 
     that featured The Brady Bunch cast members squaring off against each other. Knight won the s
     how and donated the proceeds ($49,000) to his selected charity, Zero Population Growth. 
     Continuing to pursue TV opportunities, Knight appeared on VH1's fourth season of The 
     Surreal Life. The show garnered Knight more attention than he had received in quite 
     some time, in part because he appeared shirtless on the show, revealing a well-built 
     body. During his stint on the show, he began a romance with castmate model Adrianne 
     Curry, winner of America's Next Top Model cycle 1, who is almost 25 years younger 
     than Knight. After the show, the two moved in together and got engaged, as documented 
     on the VH1 series My Fair Brady, which premiered on September 11, 2005. The series 
     was renewed for another season, and the couple wed in Curry's hometown of Joliet, 
     Illinois, on May 29, 2006, in a Gothic-style wedding." />
