     p1="The Brady Bunch is an American sitcom created by Sherwood Schwartz that aired from 
     September 26, 1969, to March 8, 1974, on ABC. The series revolves around a large blended family 
     with six children. Mike Brady (Robert Reed), a widowed architect with three sons—Greg (Barry Williams), 
     Peter (Christopher Knight), and Bobby (Mike Lookinland)—marries Carol Martin (Florence Henderson), 
     who herself has three daughters: Marcia (Maureen McCormick), Jan (Eve Plumb), and Cindy 
     (Susan Olsen). Carol and her daughters take the Brady surname. Included in the blended family 
     are Mike's live-in housekeeper, Alice Nelson (Ann B. Davis), and the boys' dog, Tiger. (In the 
     pilot episode, the girls also have a pet: a cat named Fluffy. Fluffy never appears in any other
     episodes.) The setting is a large two-story house designed by Mike, located in a Los Angeles suburb.
     Considered one of the last old-style family sitcoms, the show aired for five 
     seasons and, after its cancellation in 1974, went into syndication in September 1975. Though it 
     was never a ratings hit or a critical success during its original run, the program has since 
     become a popular syndicated staple, especially among children and teenage viewers."
     p2="The Brady Bunch's success in syndication led to several television reunion films and spin-off 
     series: The Brady Bunch Hour (1976–77), The Brady Girls Get Married (1981), The Brady Brides (1981),
     A Very Brady Christmas (1988), and The Bradys (1990). In 1995, the series was adapted into a 
     satirical comedy theatrical film titled The Brady Bunch Movie, followed by A Very Brady Sequel
     in 1996. A second sequel, The Brady Bunch in the White House, aired on Fox in November 2002 as 
     a made-for-television film. In 1997, &quot;Getting Davy Jones&quot; (season three, episode 12) 
     was ranked number 37 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time. The show's enduring 
     popularity has resulted in its widespread recognition as an American cultural icon." />
