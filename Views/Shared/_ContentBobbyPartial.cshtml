     p1="Michael Paul Lookinland (born December 19, 1960) is an American actor. He is best known for his role 
     as the youngest brother, Bobby Brady, on the ABC sitcom The Brady Bunch from 1969 to 1974, and its many 
     sequels and spinoffs. Lookinland was a TV-commercial actor before he was cast in The Brady Bunch, having
     done around thirty commercials. He had been offered two roles - Eddie on The Courtship of Eddie's Father
     and Bobby on The Brady Bunch; his parents chose the latter, feeling it would be healthier for him to be 
     around other children closer to his age rather than an only child on an all-adult cast (the role of 
     Eddie eventually went to Brandon Cruz). He has naturally sandy-colored, wavy hair. Because his hair color
     did not match TV-siblings Peter's or Greg's natural dark brown color, his was dyed dark brown and 
     straightened. Occasionally, the lights on set were so hot that his dye would run down his face. During
     the last two seasons of The Brady Bunch, his natural hair color was allowed to show."
     p2="Lookinland continued to reprise his role as Bobby Brady in the show's many sequels and spin-offs. 
     In 1976, he was uninterested in participating in The Brady Bunch Hour, so he asked for double the 
     offered salary in hopes his role would be recast, however, instead his request was accepted and 
     resulted in increased salaries for all cast members. He also reprised his role in the 1981 TV movie
     The Brady Girls Get Married, the 1988 Christmas special A Very Brady Christmas and again in the 1990
     sequel series The Bradys, in which Bobby Brady was involved in a racing-car accident, which made him 
     a wheelchair user throughout the series. Lookinland spent several years as a television camera operator
     and made an uncredited appearance in the 2000 TV movie Growing Up Brady as a camera operator filming an
     episode of The Brady Bunch. He also joined with the other Brady Bunch cast in the 2019 television series
     A Very Brady Renovation on HGTV. Having left show business, Lookinland operates a business (as of 2019) 
     that makes decorative concrete in Salt Lake City, Utah. In 2021, Lookinland returned to the world of 
     acting by starring in the Lifetime Christmas movie, Blending Christmas, alongside his Brady Bunch 
     co-stars Barry Williams, Christopher Knight, Susan Olsen, and Robbie Rist." />
