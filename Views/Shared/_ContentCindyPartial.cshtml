     p1="Susan Marie Olsen (born August 14, 1961) is an American actress and former radio host. Olsen is known
     for her role as Cindy Brady, the youngest Brady child in the sitcom The Brady Bunch for the full run of 
     the show, from 1969 to 1974. Olsen was born in Santa Monica, California, to Lawrence and DeLoice Olsen, 
     the youngest of four children. Olsen landed a number of supporting roles in television, most notably in 
     Ironside, Gunsmoke, and Julia, and appeared in the Elvis Presley movie The Trouble With Girls (1968) as
     a squeaky-clean singer in a singing contest. Her siblings are: Larry (23 years older), Christopher 
     (15 years older), and Diane (5 years older). Christopher was also a child actor whose most prominent role may be in the 
     1956 feature film The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956). Olsen landed a number of supporting roles in 
     television, most notably in Ironside, Gunsmoke, and Julia, and appeared in the Elvis Presley movie 
     The Trouble With Girls (1968) as a squeaky-clean singer in a singing contest."
     p2="At just under age eight, Olsen was cast as Cindy Brady on The Brady Bunch. As an adult, Olsen 
     has said that portraying Cindy made friendships difficult for her as a child. She most disliked the
     season two &quot;tattletale&quot; episode, in which Cindy incessantly tattles on her siblings. Because
     of the episode, she was shunned by real-life peers, who did not understand the difference between actors
     and their characters. Olsen has appeared in all Brady Bunch reunion movies with the exception of A Very 
     Brady Christmas (1988), which was filmed when she and her first husband Steve Ventimiglia were on their 
     honeymoon. In that movie, Cindy Brady was played by actress Jennifer Runyon. Olsen reprised her role as 
     Cindy Brady in the short-lived CBS spin-off series The Bradys. As a teen, Olsen was the spokesgirl for 
     Sindy doll, made by Marx Toys from the mid-1970s. As an adult, Olsen moved into the graphic design 
     business and in 1998 briefly marketed a brand of glow-in-the-dark shoes for Converse. She also worked 
     as a talk show host at the Los Angeles radio station KLSX from 1995 to 1996 with Ken Ober, and co-hosted 
     and co-wrote another radio show with comedian Allan Havey at Comedy World in 2000. She appeared in 
     episode 26 of Cartoon Network's talk show Space Ghost Coast to Coast, &quot;Switcheroo&quot;, with 
     Cassandra Peterson as &quot;Elvira, Mistress of the Dark&quot;. Olsen has also been an advocate for
     migraine sufferers since 1998. She described her headaches on Larry King Live. In 2005, VH1 ranked her 
     No. 34 in The 100 Greatest Kid Stars of television and film. In 2007, Olsen and her fellow cast members 
     were honored with the TV Pop Culture Award on the TV Land Awards." />
