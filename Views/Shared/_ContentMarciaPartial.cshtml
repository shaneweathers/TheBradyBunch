     p1="Maureen Denise McCormick (born August 5, 1956) is an American actress, singer and author. She portrayed Marcia Brady
        on the ABC television sitcom The Brady Bunch, which ran from 1969 to 1974, and reprised the role in several of the
        numerous Brady Bunch spin-offs and films, including The Brady Kids, The Brady Bunch Hour, The Brady Brides and
        A Very Brady Christmas (1988). McCormick has appeared in The Amanda Show as Moody's mom in the Moody's Point
        segment. McCormick also appeared in The Idolmaker (1980) as well as a wide range of other supporting film roles.
        In the 1980s and 1990s, she ventured into stage acting, appearing in a variety of different roles and productions
        such as Wendy Darling in Peter Pan and Betty Rizzo in Grease. McCormick also had a brief career as a recording
        artist, releasing four studio albums with the Brady Bunch cast as well as touring with them. Her only release as a
        solo artist to date is a country music album, When You Get a Little Lonely (1995)."
     p2="Since the 2000s, she has appeared on several reality television series such as VH1's Celebrity Fit Club, CMT's Gone 
     Country (which led to a short-lived spin-off series led by McCormick, Outsiders Inn) and the Australian version of 
     I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, as well as guest spots on a wide range of television series. In 2008, 
     McCormick published an autobiography, Here's the Story: Surviving Marcia Brady and Finding My True Voice, which 
     debuted at number four on The New York Times bestseller list, where it stayed for three weeks. The book was 
     published by HarperCollins and was acquired by Director of Creative Development Lisa Sharkey. While promoting 
     the book, McCormick was a guest on many news and talk shows such as Access Hollywood, The Howard Stern Show, 
     Good Day L.A., and Paula's Party. The Today Show aired an interview with McCormick about the book rather than 
     switch to a story about the 2008 recession. McCormick said that a film would likely be made about her 
     autobiography. Also in 2008, she joined the cast of the CMT reality show Gone Country, where she competed for 
     a recording contract. This led to a spin-off reality series called Outsiders Inn, in which she opened a bed 
     and breakfast in Newport, Tennessee. In 2008, McCormick became a spokesperson for Children International. In 
     March 2009, McCormick appeared on Comedy Central's roast of Larry the Cable Guy. In 2015, McCormick appeared 
     in the Australian version of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, where she lasted 42 days and was the last 
     evictee before the finale. On August 30, 2016, McCormick was revealed as one of the celebrities who would 
     compete on season 23 of Dancing with the Stars. She was partnered with professional dancer Artem Chigvintsev.
     McCormick and Chigvintsev were eliminated on the seventh week of competition and finished in 8th place. She 
     joined with the other surviving main cast members of The Brady Bunch in the 2019 television series A Very 
     Brady Renovation on HGTV. In 2021, McCormick paired up with contractor/decorator Dan Vickery in HGTV's new 
     series &quot;Frozen in Time&quot;, a new home remodeling series." />
